# college-code

This repository contains all code I have been able to compile

from Biomedical Engineering at Purdue as of 03/28/2015. 


I've done projects using: 

C, Python, MATLAB, Java, RobotC, and LabVIEW.

This repository is organized in the following manner:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Course --> Project[Language(s) Used] --> File.ext
=======
Course --> Project-Language --> Files.ext
>>>>>>> 517fe82acfe2844f44ed8354cbc675278c7db89e

I am actively using this repository to access code from school computers and my laptop, so newer projects might still be in progress.
