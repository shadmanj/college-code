# college-code

This repository contains all code I have been able to compile

from Biomedical Engineering at Purdue as of 03/28/2015. 


I've done projects using: 

C, Python, MATLAB, and Java..

This repository is organized in the following manner:

Course --> Project[Language(s) Used] --> File.ext

I am actively using this repository to access code from school computers and my laptop, so newer projects might still be in progress.
