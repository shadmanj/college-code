# college-code

This repository contains all of the code I have written in my time as a Biomedical Engineering student at Purdue University.

I've done projects using: 

C, Python, MATLAB, Java, RobotC, and LabVIEW.

This repository is organized in the following manner:

Year in College --> Course --> Project[Language(s) Used]

I am actively using this repository to access code from school computers and my laptop, so so newer projects might still be in progress.
