HODGKIN-HUXLEY SOLVER

    This project contains three scipts used to solve 1st order, 2nd order,
    and 3rd order differential equations using text files as input.
    
    The scripts are used to solve for the Hodgkin-Huxley equation which 
    models current and voltage flow through a neuron.

SEIZURE DETECTION

	This project contains various scripts designed to detect seizures from 
	a live EEG feed using variations of root-mean-square, and standard 
	deviation thresholding.

	I plan to expand this to investigate possible frequency domain analysis
	of the waves for more accurate results.
